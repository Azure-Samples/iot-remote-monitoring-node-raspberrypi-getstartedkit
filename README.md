# Connect your Microsoft Azure IoT Raspberry Pi 3 Starter Kit to the remote monitoring solution

The Node.js code in this repository supports a set of tutorials that help you learn how to connect a Raspberry Pi 3 device to the Azure IoT Suite remote monitoring solution. Choose the tutorial appropriate to whether you have the sensor hardware available to use with your Raspberry Pi and the scenario you are interested in:

## The tutorials

| Tutorial | Notes |
| -------- | ----- |
| [Simulated telemetry (Basic)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-suite/iot-suite-raspberry-pi-kit-node-get-started-simulator) | Simulates sensor data. Uses a standalone Raspberry Pi. |
| [Real sensor (Intermediate)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-suite/iot-suite-raspberry-pi-kit-node-get-started-basic) | Uses data from a BME280 sensor connected to your Raspberry Pi. |
| [Implement firmware update (Advanced)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-suite/iot-suite-raspberry-pi-kit-node-get-started-advanced) | Uses data from a BME280 sensor connected to your Raspberry Pi. Enables remote firmware updates on your Raspberry Pi. |
